As a self-paced student of the Flatiron school, I've had to work hard to find ways to keep myself moving forward. Covid-19 increased my time available to work on the course, but took away the structure and routine I had built. Here is my new strategy:

1. Decide a minimum and maximum time you can spend on coding during each day. My current minimum is four hours, maximum is eight, and I code six days per week.
2. Count the number of lessons and readings you want to get done that week and divide it by the number of days you plan to work.
3. Each morning, work for the minimum number of hours. At that point, if you've finished the number of lessons you wanted to complete, move on to outside study, networking, career prep, or extra practice activities. If you haven't, continue working until you are happy with your progress or you've reached your maximum hours.
4. Additionally, stop if you're too tired or distracted to truly focus. If you find yourself rereading the same sentence of a reading over and over, you'll be more productive tomorrow. However, try the below tips before deciding to stop early!

## Tips for when you're too tired or unfocused to continue working
1. Try some basic self-care like hydrating, going for a walk, or eating a snack.
2. Take a longer break - an hour or so - to do any non-coding activity of choice.
3. Take a 20min power name
4. If all else fails, watch coding videos that review a topic you're already mostly familiar with! This way you are still studying, but it's less taxing on your brain.

**Happy coding! Remember that it is a marathon and not a sprint, so come up with a sustainable pace for yourself and sprinkle in frequent short breaks!**
